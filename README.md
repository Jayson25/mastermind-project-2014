# mastermind project 2014

## Introduction

Very first project ever made. It is a two weeks project for the python course.

This project is divided into 3 main parts:
- console display
- graphics display
- backend

We had to create a game named masterming (see wiki <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)">here</a> to learn more about the game). 

## Tools used

During the development of this project, we had to use python 3.x with pygame. The editing of the code was done on notepad++. Pygame is an SDL inspired graphic API that allows to create GUI applications with python. In order to make this project more appealing to the examinator, we added images sprites, as well as music files.
